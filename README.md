# Global Renewable Energy and Sectoral Electrification (GREaSE) Model
**Version 1.0 - Release Notes**

Welcome to GREaSE, and thank you for your interest!

This version of the GREaSE model accompanies the original peer-reviewed publication:
Hopeward, J., Davis, R., O'Connor, S. and Akiki, P. (2025) The Global Renewable Energy and Sectoral Electrification (GREaSE) Model for Rapid Energy Transition Scenarios, *Energies* 18(9), https://doi.org/10.3390/en18092205

You can download the full paper (free and open access) here:

The mathematical model is based on a conceptual model using causal loop diagrams (CLDs). The CLD model is maintained in 'kumu' at:

This version (Version 1.0) is the inaugural release of the model.

Please report any bugs/errors/issues to James Hopeward at james.hopeward@unisa.edu.au

## Getting started - using built-in scenarios
* Download the 'GREaSE - Version 1.0.xlsx' spreadsheet file and open in MS Excel
* Open the tab 'Front end' - you should see a series of charts
* Select built-in scenarios from the drop-down lists in each chart (population, per-capita activity, and climate policy)
* Modify the electrification scenario using the slide controls in the electrification chart

## Modifying model parameters
* The 'Static Parameters' tab contains the parameters arranged in the Tables from Hopeward et al. (2025) - i.e. assumed values of non-renewable and renewable resources
* You may like to explore model sensitivity e.g. to larger or smaller renewable saturation potential, larger or smaller fossil fuel or nuclear energy resources, etc.
* The 'Electrification Scenario' tab contains the assumed maximum level of electrification by demand sector - modifying these parameters gives you the ability to explore sectoral electrification potential at more granular detail than the overall scenario on the 'Front end' tab

## Alternative growth scenarios
* The three base  scenarios of population growth are taken from United Nations (2024) (cited in Hopeward et al., 2025). You may choose to replace any of these scenarios with alternative population scenarios.
* There are four built-in scenarios of per-capita energy, explained in the paper (Hopeward et al., 2025). You may choose to replace any of these with alternative growth/degrowth scenarios.

## Extending / modifying the model
It is the hope of the research team that a community of practice can form, to share, build on and improve the model over time - including improving the equations, and testing new relationships and feedbacks between variables. Please feel free to get in touch if you'd like to be part of this community!
